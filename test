you preview a video file on iOS within safari, if you close the preview modal without playing the video then the OS video control interface is left behind and also have to be closed before you can return to the main drive page. \r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**\r\n1. Log in to Files on Safari within iOS\r\n2. Upload a movie\r\n3. Preview movie\r\n4. Close preview modal without playing the video\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\nAfter closing the video the OS video controls are left behind and have to be closed before you can return to the drive page.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nClosing the modal should take the user back to the main drive page\r\n\r\n**Video**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3982665/155373064-c1aedd74-0af8-47e5-8a43-00bf73bab0f5.mov\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\n- This is specific to Safari on iOS. It doesn't happen on Firefox on iOS or on MacOS version of Safari, Android etc. \r\n\r\n- iOS is the only platform that doesn't auto-play the videos when they are previewed. If you play the video and then close the preview modal everything works so perhaps the fix for this is to ensure videos auto-play like they do on every other platform?

I just checked again on 2 different iPhones, both on 15.3.1 and it's still happening on those for me 🤦‍♂️.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact it only happens if you don't play the video before closing (and that most users will want to play when they go to the preview) and it's not affecting all iPhones / iOS versions then maybe we need to keep this in backlog until we have better reproduction steps? \r\n\r\nIt's feeling like more of a quirk with the way Safari and its video controls are handling the video but it's strange that it's not happening 100%. Not sure if it's related to auto-play.
